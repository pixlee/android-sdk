        This example demonstrates when you have to fire \'Opened Widget\' and \'Widget Visible\'.\n\n
        Be aware of the difference between \'Opened Widget\' and \'Widget Visible\'.\n\n
        \'Opened Widget\': You should fire this when firing the api is done and loading the photo data into your own view for the widget is complete.\n\n
        \'Widget Visible\': \'Opened Widget\' should be fired first. Then, you can fire this when your own view for the widget started to be visible on the screen.
